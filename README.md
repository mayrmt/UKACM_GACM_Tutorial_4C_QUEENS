## Welcome

Welcome to the two-day tutorial on advanced multiphysics simulation and analysis workflows using the open-source frameworks **[4C](https://4c-multiphysics.org)** and **[QUEENS](https://www.queens-py.org)**. This event is part of the [2025 UKACM-GACM Autumn School](https://www.ukacm-gacm-school.net/home) and is designed to provide participants with direct, hands-on experience applying modern simulation tools to complex scientific and engineering problems.

## What to Expect

This tutorial emphasizes practical experience and active participation. Over two days, participants will:

- **Day 1: 4C – Multiphysics Simulation Framework**
  Learn to formulate and solve physical problems using the modular, parallel finite element code 4C. Topics will include solid mechanics, contact, and fluid/solid interaction (FSI).

- **Day 2: QUEENS – Multi-Query Analysis Framework**
  Apply the solver-agnostic Python tool QUEENS for simulation analytics and probabilistic analysis. Topics will include parameter studies, optimization and uncertainty quantification.

- **Combined Use**
  Demonstrate the interoperability of 4C and QUEENS through coupled examples integrating multiphysics modeling and uncertainty quantification.

## Getting Started

A pre-configured virtual machine with all required software will be provided. Participants are asked to download the image of the virtual machince to their machines prior to the workshop. Setup instructions will be provided during the introductory session.

---

## Materials Overview

The tutorial includes the following materials:

- Markdown and jupyter notebooks for interactive tutorials
- 4C input files for simulation cases
- QUEENS scripts for analysis workflows
- Lecture slides and reference documentation
- Supplementary reading and selected literature

---

## Collaboration and Exchange

We encourage active engagement and scientific exchange throughout the tutorial. This event is intended to foster an open-source, interdisciplinary community around computational modeling and simulation.

---

## Vision

Numerical simulation has become a cornerstone of scientific discovery. The combined use of 4C and QUEENS offers a robust foundation for extending deterministic simulation to include rigorous uncertainty quantification. This tutorial introduces participants to a scalable and reproducible approach for advanced computational analysis in science and engineering.
